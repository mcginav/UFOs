# UFOs

### Overview of Project:
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I've added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

### Results: 
The table is filterable with multiple criteria. I have added filters for city, state, country, and shape. Someone can look up information using one or more of these criteria to find information about possible sightings.

Searches can be conducted using one critereia like the date (1/1/2010):

In this example the date remained 1/1/2010, but the state of ca was used to limit the results:

And here, "light" was selected to narrow the results down even futher:

### Summary:
Drawbacks of this new design:
* I liked the filter button in the original design. I think it would be cleaner to enter in all the information you are looking for then executing the search.
* If you wanted to know all the sightings in a specific year, you would have to gather all the dates of the year and parse through that information.

Recommendations for further development:
* I would recommend changing the placeholders so that it doesn't appear that the search is done using the placeholder criteria.
* I would also include a drop down menu so that people could search using the criteria that is availble in the results.
